Define Monolithic architecture - Monolithic architecture is a software design pattern where an entire application is built as a single, indivisible unit. In this architecture, all the application's components, such as the user interface, business logic, and database access, are tightly coupled and packaged together as a single deployable artifact.
Explain microservices in your own understanding - Microservices allows greater flexibility and agility in the development process. Microservice allows an application to be modified and updated without affecting the entire system.
Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why? - As explained earlier, this architecture divides the application into a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services, each responsible for performing a specific business capability. Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for greater flexibility and agility in the development process.

What does REPL stand for? - REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop
